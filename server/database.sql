-- Your postgresql will contain multiple databases. 
-- Each database will contain a bunch of tables. 
-- Each table will contain, data that's relevant to that table.

-- In this file we are going to execute the following tasks:
-- 1. Create a database called todo_database
-- 2. Inside todo_database, create a table called todo
-- 3. Define a schema; this is important because we don't want to put anything inside our database. 
--    We want to be specific about what will go in the database.

-- We will use the following commands to move around the database:
-- \l (this will list all databases in postgresql)
-- \c (move inside a database)
-- \dt (show a table in database)
